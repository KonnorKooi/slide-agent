## Styling

Uses CSS custom properties for theming with:
- Royal blue primary color (#4169e1)
- Automatic dark/light mode detection
- Persistent theme preferences
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Development

1. **Component Development:** Use Storybook to develop and test components in isolation
2. **Type Checking:** Run `npm run type-check` before commits
3. **Testing:** All components have comprehensive Storybook stories

## Deployment

The frontend can be deployed to any platform supporting Next.js:
- Vercel (recommended)
- Netlify
- Railway
- Self-hosted

Make sure to set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_MASTRA_URL` environment variable to point to your deployed Mastra server.

## API Integration

The frontend expects a Mastra server running with:
- SlideAgent configured
- Google Slides tools available
- OAuth credentials properly set up
